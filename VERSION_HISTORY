CURRENT_VERSION: 20240510.1 (10May2024)

Version 2.0  (22Sep2021)
- Switched to Python 3
- FLAG_REMOVE_DATFILES_OF_SEGMENTS = 1 by default

******************************
Version 1.1.6-dev (17May2021)
- Added "pm_get_closest_beams" tool
- Fixed bug that made the code stall when doing -init_default with a filterbank input file
- Searching of the full-length data is now not mandatory
- Summary of candidates now reports significances
- "pm_inspect_cands" now labels all the candidates that have been inspected, including the bad ones
- "pm_survey_sensitivity" now also take the DM step size into consideration
- If STEP_RFIFIND = 0, avoid loading the mask file, just check its presence for faster precessing
- Fixed bug in pm_split_datfile, which could produce chunks with an odd number of samples
- Customizable number of DMs processed at once by prepsubband via the parameter "NUM_SIMULTANEOUS_DMS_PREPSUBBAND"

******************************
Version 1.1.5 (08Jun2020)

- Proper handling of the *_empty candidate files
- Added option (parameter FLAG_REMOVE_DATFILES_OF_SEGMENTS) to remove the timeseries of chunks after being searched, for significant disk space saving
- Some output polishing


******************************
Version 1.1.4 (27May2020)

- Fixed bug that occurred when reading the start MJD of filterbank files
- Added support to PRESTO v3.0.1's new sifting.py module ('cmp_sigma' replaced by key=sifting.attrgetter('sigma'), reverse=True)


******************************
Version 1.1.3 (05May2020)

- Now the pipeline check whether a DM trial has already been searched and, if so, does not recreate the .fft file
- Better printouts to keep track of the pipeline progress
- Fixed bug that caused the pipeline to crash if no valid candidates are found in a given chunk
- Jerk search and folding of the time series now disabled by default


******************************
Version 1.1.2 (01May2020)

- Fixed bug that prevented the pipeline from running if STEP_RFIFIND = 0
- Fixed bug that prevented the removal of the *.fft files even if FLAG_REMOVE_FFTFILES = 1
- Some output polishing


******************************
Version 1.1.1 (27Apr2020)

- Recognition of known binary pulsars now independent of the particular binary model


******************************
Version 1.1 (24Apr2020)

 - Introduced recognition of known pulsars in the data and options about their folding
 - All candidates now written onto a summary file in a human-readable format
 - Updated description of JERKSEARCH_WMAX parameter
 - Fixed bug that prevented folding of the time series
 - Some code and output polishing


******************************
Version 1.0 (16Apr2020)

 - Removed dependency on PyPulsar
 - Fixed bug that prevented the code from making an RFIFIND mask by itself
 - Introduced more RFIFIND parameters in the configuration file
 - Warn the user if more than 50% of the frequency channels are masked
 - THREADS_MAX parameter is now NUM_SIMULTANEOUS_FOLDS
 - Some code and output polishing


******************************
Version 1.0-beta (10Apr2020)

 - First public release
